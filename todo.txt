Southern Code React Test:


Using Create React App or your custom solution (React is a must), build an app that: -> done

- Connects to the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/) -> done

- Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint -> done

- Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit) -> done

- The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)

- Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera

- By default it shows the latest photos for current day

- Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)

- Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)

- Please use a linter!

-Include a few tests.

Optional:

- Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted)

- We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested in seeing how you think and organize a project.

When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL.
